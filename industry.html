<P align=justify>[288 Pages Report] The global <STRONG>Electric Vehicle Market</STRONG> size is projected to grow from
    4,093 thousand units in 2021 to 34,756 thousand units by 2030, at a CAGR of 26.8%. Factors such as growing demand
    for low emission commuting and governments supporting long range, zero emission vehicles through subsidies & tax
    rebates have compelled the manufacturers to provide electric vehicles around the world. This has led to a growing
    demand for electric vehicles in the market. Countries around the world have set up targets for emission reductions
    according to their own capacity.</P>
<P align=justify>Increasing investments by governments across the globe to develop EV charging stations and Hydrogen
    fueling stations along with incentives offered to buyers will create opportunities for OEMs to expand their revenue
    stream and geographical presence. The market in Asia Pacific is projected to experience steady growth owing to the
    high demand for lower cost-efficient and low-emission vehicles, while the North American and European market is
    fast-growing markets due to the government initiatives and growing high-performance Passenger vehicle segment.
    However, the low presence of EV charging stations and hydrogen fuel stations, higher costs involved in initial
    investments, and performance constraints could hamper the growth of the global electric vehicle market.</P>

<H3 style="FONT-SIZE: 16px">COVID-19 Impact on the Electric Vehicle Market:</H3>
<P align=justify>The production and sales of new vehicles had come to a halt across the globe as the whole ecosystem had
    been disrupted in the initial outbreak of COVID 19. OEMs had to wait until lockdowns were lifted to resume
    production, which affected their businesses. Hence, vehicle manufacturers had to adjust the production volume. Also,
    component manufacturing was suspended, and small Tier II and Tier III manufacturers faced liquidity issues. The
    automotive industry is highly capital-intensive and relies on frequent financing to continue operations. Thus, the
    production suspension during the initial months of the outbreak and lower demand had an unprecedented impact on EV
    manufacturers in the initial months of the pandemic.</P>
<P align=justify>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries had imposed a complete lockdown of more than two months,
    which, in turn, has impacted vehicle production. Manufacturing units around the world were shut down, and vehicle
    sales have taken a huge hit. However, the majority of the automakers resumed vehicle production with limited
    production and necessary measures. Conditions improved in the latter months, but overall EV manufacturers did not
    suffer much as demand for zero emission vehicles increased during the latter months of 2020. This led to an overall
    increase in demand for electric vehicles in the market.</P>
<P align=justify>However, EV’s had a growing demand in the covid-19 period. This led to a growing demand for EV
    production around the world. In the first few months, however, the production of most companies was affected due to
    lockdowns and logistics problems. However, post lockdowns, demand for EV’s surged as governments around the world
    increasingly encouraged changing to low emission fuel vehicles. Many countries also increased their EV charging
    stations and hydrogen fueling stations across their states. This led to a growing demand for BEV’s, PHEV’s and
    FCEV’s in the market from June to December 2020 and in first few months of 2021. Overall, there wasn’t much of a
    loss for the electric vehicle market during the pandemic due to its increase in demand.</P><br>
<H2 style="FONT-SIZE: 16px; COLOR: #0099cc">Market Dynamics: </H2>
<H3 style="FONT-SIZE: 16px">Driver: Rising price of petroleum</H3>
<P align=justify>According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), 101.95 million barrels per day was
    consumed in 2019. The prices of petrol in the international market have been rising over the years except for
    exceptional times such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in prices is due to the high demand for petrol and it
    is a non-renewable energy resource which is expected to be exhausted during the next few decades. Fluctuations in
    the demand and supply of petrol leads to increasing prices. Even though various treaties have been formed to control
    the prices of petrol in the international market, prices have been rising over the years. As a majority of the
    countries are required to import petrol, its usage contributes to lowering the balance of trade of the economy. The
    limited petroleum reserves and rising prices of fuel have led automakers to consider alternative fuel sources for
    their vehicles.</P><br>
<H3 style="FONT-SIZE: 16px">Restraint: High initial investment for setting up EV fast charging infrastructure</H3>
<P align=justify>The initial investment in setting up a fast charging system is significantly higher compared to petrol,
    CNG, or LPG fuel stations. This has been a major restraint for countries around the world in adopting EVs on a
    higher scale during the past decade. Technological enhancements are expected to negate this restraint, leading to
    decreasing costs. The cost for EV fast charging is high due to the higher equipment costs and the requirement for an
    additional fast charger to install a transformer to connect the grid and charging system. This has led to the slower
    development of charging networks around the world which have gained traction during the past few years due to
    vehicle emission concerns. </P><br>
<H3 style="FONT-SIZE: 16px">Opportunity: Government initiatives pertaining to EV’s</H3>
<P align=justify>Countries around the world have set up targets of around 2050 to reduce vehicle emissions. They have
    started promoting the development and sales of EV’s and related charging infrastructure. For instance, the US
    government invested USD 5 billion in 2017 to promote electric vehicle infrastructure such as charging stations.
    Several governments are providing various kinds of incentives such as low or zero registration fees and exemptions
    from import tax, purchase tax, and road tax. Furthermore, countries such as Norway and Germany are investing
    significantly in promoting sales of EVs. Thus, due to the large incentives and subsidies in Europe, a high growth
    rate in the sale of electric vehicles is observed. This has led to the growth in the demand for components and
    equipment associated with EV charging operations such as charging cables, connectors, adapters, and portable
    chargers. Also, as part of a partnership between the US departments of energy and transportation, a 2020 vision for
    a national fast-charging network is expected to be developed, with potential longer-term innovations which include
    up to 350 kW of direct current fast charging. Stringent CO2 emission norms have increased the demand for electric
    vehicles. Governments are investing significantly in providing incentives and subsidies to encourage sales of EVs.
    These steps taken by governments around the world will help in increasing demand for EV’s in the coming decade. </P><br>
<H3 style="FONT-SIZE: 16px">Challenge: Insufficient standardization of EV charging infrastructure</H3>
<P align=justify>Factors such as the growth of the electric vehicle market and variation in charging loads have
    emphasized the need for the standardization of electric vehicle charging stations. Certain EV charging stations may
    only be compatible with a certain type of voltage. For instance, AC charging stations provide a voltage of 120V AC
    through level 1 charging stations and 208/240V AC through level 2 charging stations. On the other hand, DC charging
    stations provide fast charging through 480V AC. Governments need to standardize charging infrastructure for the
    development of a favorable ecosystem and an increase in the sales of EVs. Different countries use different
    standards for fast charging. Japan uses CHAdeMO; Europe, US, and Korea use CCS; and China uses GB/T. The Indian
    government had mandated the installation of both, CHAdeMO and CCS methods since India has not reached
    standardization in fast charging methods. Though, this mandate increased the installation cost of charging stations
    and hence in July 2019, the government changed the guidelines and allowed charging station developers to choose the
    method they prefer. US-based electric car maker Tesla uses high-performance superchargers that are unique to Tesla
    and cannot be used for other EVs. The lack of standardization across countries may impact the installation of
    charging stations and hamper the growth of the <A

        target=_blank>Electric Vehicle Charging Station market</A>.</P><br>
<H3 style="FONT-SIZE: 16px">The BEV segment to be the largest segment by the end of the forecast period</H3>
<P align=justify>Due to increasing concerns for emission reductions by countries around the world, BEVs have an
    increasing demand. Earlier due to the low availability of charging stations and high cost of EV batteries, BEVs had
    a low demand. However, due to the decreasing cost of EV batteries at a fast and steady rate coupled with increasing
    EV range and a growing EV charging network around the world, the demand for BEVs has been rising significantly.
    Among the top sold EVs in the market in 2020, a majority are BEVs. The Asia Pacific region accounts for the largest
    BEV market with countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea leading BEV sales. Strong government support and
    favorable policies are the major factors for the fast growth of BEVs in the region along with fast popularization of
    EV charging stations. The cost of the BEV of local players in this region is low compared to that in other regions,
    leading to a high demand for various low cost EVs in this market. Europe was the fastest-growing region during the
    past few years due to new environmental policies, but long-term growth is expected to slow down in the coming years.
    Countries such as Germany, France, Netherlands, Norway, and the UK have been undertaking efforts for the fast
    development of EVs in their countries. </P><br>
<H3 style="FONT-SIZE: 16px">Rear-wheel Drive EV’s to be higher in demand during the forecast period</H3>
<P align=justify>The demand for RWD EVs has been on the increase across all regions, particularly across Asia Pacific
    and Europe. This is due to its easier vehicle control and growing demand for these vehicles. North America also has
    seen a faster growth in these vehicles with Tesla Model 3 Standard version, BMW i3, Volkswagen ID4, Porsche Tycan,
    etc. leading the market. In the coming decade, the growth of RWD EV’s will be highest in MEA due to its newer market
    and mostly across Asia Pacific. The Wuling Hongguang Mini EV which made a big splash in the EV market in 2020 is
    also an RWD popular across Asia and Europe.</P><br>
<H3 style="FONT-SIZE: 16px">The Asia Pacific market is projected to hold the largest share by 2030</H3>
<P align=justify>The Asia Pacific EV market is led by countries like China, Japan and South Korea. China being the
    world’s largest EV producer and user has a dominance in the EV industry in the region. Their government has taken
    steps including subsidies for EV buyers, compulsory laws by which all vehicle manufacturers need to manufacture EV’s
    per number of vehicles manufactured, large support to installation of EV charging points across major cities and
    regulations against excessive polluting vehicles. Japan and South Korea have also been growing their EV market.
    Their governments have supported the EV demand growth by installing EV charging stations, making emission norms,
    setting up deadlines for shifting to full or hybrid EVs from ICE vehicles, etc. India is also working on increasing
    its EV demand in the market. The new vehicle scrappage policy in which old vehicles can be scrapped off for changing
    to low emission ones and other upcoming policies will help the country become the region's fastest-growing market
    for EV’s in the coming years. </P><br>
